Module 4 Coding Assignment
Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers

Let's write a little bit of Javascript programming code to practice what we've learned! Woohoo! :-)

Summary: 

In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. 
If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.

However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. 
Using the things we've learned in this module, your job will be to fix the code in those libraries.

Note to Peer Reviewer: See the output in console or in my attached picture on my repository. Thanks
